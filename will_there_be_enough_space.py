#Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents.
#With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! 
# He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
#If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

def enough(cap, on, wait):
    if (cap-on)>wait:
        return 0
    else: return wait-(cap-on)
